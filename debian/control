#Package: lemon
#Architecture: any
#Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
#Description: The Lemon Parser Generator
# Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same
# job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc
# clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
# the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
# parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
# reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
# that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
# use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
# embedded controllers.
